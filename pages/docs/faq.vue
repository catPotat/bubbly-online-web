            <h3>How is community type determined?</h3>
            <p>
                A community can be:<br>
                - Public: Anyone can view and join<br>
                - Closed: Anyone can view. Anyone with an invite code can join<br>
                - Secret: Only members can view. Anyone with an invite code can join<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Why isn't my reputation updating?</h3>
            <p>
                Please allow up to 3 hours for your reputation score to update
            </p>
            <h3>My GIFs are not animating</h3>
            <p>
                GIFs and PNGs will not be compressed as long as they are less than 256kB
            </p>
